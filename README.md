# football-index-watchlist

Football Index Watchlist allows you to track the movement of football player prices. It is built with a Javascript frontend and a Rails API backend.

## Description

The Rails API is designed to simulate the share price movement of football players on the football stock market www.footballindex.co.uk. A Javascript frontend communicates with the API to display current share prices, and allows the user to add a player, along with the current share price, to a watchlist and follow the players progress.
